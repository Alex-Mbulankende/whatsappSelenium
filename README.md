# whatsappSelenium

This is a very much WIP whatsapp-bot using selenium to control whatsapp-web.

---
## Setup

Use [this](https://github.com/Mawalu/whatsapp-phishing) to get your whatsapp-web _secrets_ file.


Then run

    git clone https://github.com/jakibaki/whatsappSelenium

to clone this repository.

Put your _secrets_-file in the whatsappSelenium folder and run

    python3 whatsApp.py

to start the bot. (you need chromedriver in your PATH)

You can edit the messageHandler method to do whatever you want.
